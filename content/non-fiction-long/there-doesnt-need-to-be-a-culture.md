# There doesn't need to be a culture war

Democrats vs republicans. Urban vs rural. North vs south. We are a nation divided on our cultural identity. What are our core values? Freedom? Equity? Opportunity? Strength? What moral system do we value above others? Who are we?

This is the central question ripping America apart. Great political clashes are unfolding as we struggle through our identity crisis. We let a fox in the hen house from the thrash. This central division is our great weakness, one that arises from within. All great civilizations die because of rot from within.

We have spent hundreds of years trying to decide who we are through violent and nonviolent protests. From the civil war to the civil rights movement, Americans have been constantly redefining ourselves.

But now it is time to evolve past this great conflict. We can stop the battle that is the culture war, by admitting there is no one correct culture. There is no moral objectivity, no God to declare one culture morally superior to another.

Once we accept this, we move into the future. Needing to know the strongest gladiator kills too many good people. There is no need for this violence in the name of morality, we can move forward with pluralistic acceptance.

Needing to assert your strength is the most obvious sign of weakness. It reveals insecurity. We must beat out insecurity and fear from our minds. Grow in love and acceptance.
