# We were conditioned to only care about intelligence

From childhood, society praises academic achievement. "Sally can already count to 10!" "Great work on your science exam" "Ben got into a top college, you must be so proud!" Gifted programs filter out high achievers while others fall behind.

This focus makes economic sense—students excelling academically earn more as adults, creating productive workers. However, society has become narrow in its productivity obsession. While economics matters for physical needs and resource management, spiritual and emotional wellbeing deserve equal attention.

Somewhere along the way, communities stopped valuing empathy, kindness, and moral development in children. The result: a culture prioritizing wealth accumulation over community care and relationships.

I contrast my own experience with my neurodivergent sister. I excel academically; my sister possesses exceptional people skills and builds meaningful friendships effortlessly. Yet she worries about "keeping up with the other kids" academically, fearing reduced life success.

I argue this concern misses reality. As artificial intelligence automates analytical work, interpersonal abilities become increasingly valuable. We don't need more people who can do complicated mental math—we have calculators for that.

After moving in with my partner, I discovered relationship skills—patience, forgiveness, kindness—proved more challenging and rewarding than academic achievements. Despite 16 years of education, I received minimal training in emotional development and relationship-building.

While impressed by my Stanford degree, I find authentic relationships infinitely more fulfilling. I question how society can rebalance educational priorities toward developing moral, empathetic humans alongside intellectual capabilities.
