# Can we salvage Christianity?

I’ve been writing a lot about spiritual systems, and I’d be remiss to not deeply consider the traditional western spiritual systems before embarking to build something new. For all its flaws, Christianity is the western world’s spiritual heritage with lots of passed down wisdom.

Our current cultural rejection of Christianity reminds me of a teenage girl rejecting the color pink, after being obsessed with it as a child. There is an intense need to distance ourselves from it at this developmental phase, but as time goes on I think we will be able to look at it with kinder eyes, and situate it in a balanced place among the other colors.

Christianity was what we knew before we knew anything else. It’s the bedrock of European and western society, and it’s hard to overstate its influence. If nothing else we could view it with nostalgia, like we view the bedtime stories our parents read to us when we were young. Nothing to hold too tightly to now, but formative during an important time.

We should all continue to understand Christianity for its influence in thought and because it is our set of shared myths. In the age of science, it may be hard to come by a set of grand stories that inspire awe quite like the stories in the Bible. The parables have millennia of wisdom passed down from generation to generation. There are definitely lessons to learn from it, even if you reject some of the fundamental premises like an omniscient god.

It is also important to understand Christianity to understand art. I personally love art that depicts a known story, the painting is less trying to tell a story and more riffing on a known concept. It puts all the characters in conversation over and over again. Religious art is one of our great pieces of cultural heritage, and at least the artists should understand the Bible stories as the origin of art.

Maybe we will even be able to reform Christianity and bring it into the modern age. Maybe the church will accept the premise that the Bible is all a myth, there is no god in the sky, and preach not from an authoritarian tower but from a kinder, more human point of view. From a logistical perspective, it’d be much easier to reintegrate spirituality back into American life with the existing infrastructure of churches and holidays. But the church is not known for being at the cutting edge of thought.
