# We are all infinitesimally small

The universe is infinite. Our brains can’t really conceive of infinity, but it’s there. Out from your chest space goes on forever. Everything we have ever known or created as a species is finite, on a singular planet in a singular galaxy. And there are infinite galaxies. This is one of those obvious facts that has become cliche, but I don't think we have spent enough time collectively processing it.

Our whole species is 1/ infinity. It’s the closest you can get to zero without actually being zero. We are some undefined valued, we aren’t even a proper number.

There will always be so much more information out there than we will ever be able to comprehend. There are dimensions of reality going on around us that we can perceive (light, sound) and there are realities going on around us that we know about and can use tools to measure (microwaves, radio waves) and there are realities going on around us that we haven’t even begun to understand. There are an infinite amount of unknown unknowns.

We will never even begin to understand the world around us. As much as we want to be infinite, even as we learn more and more about the edges of the universe, our selves and our species will always be finite. Any semblance of control we think we have over our lives is ultimately an illusion, everything could change in a moment and we would never see it coming.

I love science and have spent most of my life studying it. It’s an important tool to make sense of the world around us. But in practicing science, we must always practice humility. There is too much information in our universe for science to ever be able to explain it all. There will always be questions that science just cannot answer, that science might not even be able to ask. We can’t forget how little we know.

There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy

To me, spirituality is about accepting this uncomfortable truth. It’s about relinquishing control and accepting the mystery in the human condition. Few would dispute that science is a Good Thing and that we should continue to invest in research. But somewhere along the way we forgot there’s no way to know it all. All things in moderation; we need both science and spirituality.
