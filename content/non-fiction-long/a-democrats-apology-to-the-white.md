# A Democrat's apology to the white working class

The Democratic Party has failed us all in allowing Trump to rise to power. But the group we have failed the most is the white working class citizens who were left behind and felt that a demagogue was better than another four years of the same liberal agenda.

Social mobility has been decreasing for white people in rural areas, and you have felt this pain deeply through unemployment, falling quality of life, and increased deaths of despair.

With the changing world and increased globalization, your manufacturing jobs were caught in the crossfire. When your manufacturing jobs went away, democrats apathetically told you to reskill and find other work. And if you didn’t, you deserved to be left behind. There was no consideration for the history and identity tied up with your profession and the significance those jobs held in your communities. Hyper rational, apathetic statements like this are no way to lead, and you left the party.

Democrats tried to build on the black and women’s liberation movements of the 60’s and 70’s, but got lost somewhere along the way. What was meant to be uplifting black people became shaming white people who didn’t know the right vocabulary; what was meant to be including women became villainizing men.

We forgot these movements were meant to be rooted in empathy and love, not hate and division. Martin Luther King famously said “Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that". The Democratic Party became so defensive of minorities that it forgot to give the benefit of the doubt.

Every city, state, and neighborhood in America has a history of intolerance and exclusion of minorities. Our country was built by enslaved people, and no one believes we should return to that world order. We all must do our part to root out deeply entrenched mentalities and stereotypes designed to divide us.

We must also remember that those stereotypes designed to divide do not benefit either of us, they benefit the ultra wealthy. White supremacy is how the plantation owner convinces the overseer his actions oppressing black people are morally acceptable, but it is the plantation owner who profits off both their labor. It is the plantation owner spinning illusions of division to keep his laborers focused on fighting each other, instead of uniting against him to seize the means of production.

Division of people to distract from wealth hoarding is the same political trap we are stuck in right now. White working class men are not falling in the social order because black people and gender minorities are rising in it. The whole point of capitalism is to grow the pie. Your quality of life is going down because billionaires like Trump and Elon Musk are hoarding all the new wealth that technology is creating.

America is a strong nation, there are enough resources to go around. No child needs to live in food insecurity, no sick person should be denied health care because they cannot pay for it or are uninsured. We live in an abundant society where we can produce enough resources for everyone. There does not need to be poverty in America. There is poverty in America because a few greedy billionaires are rigging the system to enrich themselves, and we just put one in the Oval Office.

We have let these illusions of division hurt us long enough. Democrats failed to see how perverted the shadows of the liberation movement had become, and continued to fuel the political machine in our own selfish grasps at power. As the economy grew and changed, we forgot to treat those who had lost with empathy and care. I am so deeply sorry for this.

The only way for us to move forward as a country is together. Once we admit the wrong that has been done, the hurt that has been caused, and own our mistakes, we will be able to work together to take on our nation's existential threats. We must figure out how to heal the spiritual malaise that has infected our nation and redistribute wealth and resources more fairly. This is how we build a better future not just for the few, but for everyone.
