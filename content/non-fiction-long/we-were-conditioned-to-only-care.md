# We were conditioned to only care about intelligence

From an early age, we are praised for intelligence. “Sally can already count to 10!” “Great work on your science exam” “Ben got into a top college, you must be so proud!” We filter the brightest minds out into gifted programs, give them Special Status, and leave the other students behind.

This behavior makes sense, kids who excel at school are more likely to make more money when they enter the work force. Society needs as many productive workers as we can get. There are a lot of bellies to feed.

But we have become myopic in our pursuit for productivity. The economy is important for meeting our physical needs and making the most of finite resources, which is important, but we must tend to our spiritual and emotional needs as well.

Somewhere along the way, we stopped praising kids for being empathetic and kind and moral. This produced a culture that cares more about making money than taking care of the people around them and building communities.

My sister is neurodivergent and writing this out makes me think of her. We move through the world very differently, I am a math mind and she is a people person. Everywhere she goes, she almost instantly makes meaningful friendships. I do well on tests.

Sometimes she tells me she worries about keeping up with the other kids in her classes and that she will be ultimately less successful in life. She doesn’t believe me when I tell her her social skills are going to take her so much further in life than anything they are teaching in her school. AI is going to render the skills I have been praised my whole life for excelling at largely obsolete. We don’t need more people who can do complicated mental math— we have calculators for that. We need people who make others feel understood and can build communities.

Now I am in a long term relationship with a man I love very much, and since we have moved in together I have had to learn what feels like a whole new skill set (patience, forgiveness, kindness, compassion). My parents and aunts and uncles and grandparents made a good faith effort to instill these values and skills in me, but there’s only so much a nuclear family can do, especially when you think about the amount of resources spent on my formal education. At a societal level, more resources should have been spent on teaching me the skills I needed to form lasting relationships.

People seem very impressed when I tell them about my Stanford education, but what has been more challenging and infinitely more rewarding is my relationships, both with my partner and my friends. Meaningful relationships take work but are worth investing in to live a well rounded life.

I’m not really sure how we close the gap here, maybe it has something to do with how we raise our kids or structure education. What I do know, at the end of 16 years of education, is that I have received too much attention and praise for skills that only amounted to me making money, with very little time spent training me to be a moral empathetic human.
