# What white Americans can learn from Malcom X

Malcom X is a polarizing figure in American history. Leader of the Black Panther party and the more radical counterbalance to MLK, Malcolm X is known for his “extreme” views of what black people should do to uplift themselves and their position in society.

I find him fascinating because of how his views on the subject, and on the world, evolved over the course of his life. To me, he was a man born in hatred. He was a victim of the system without a strong family support system to protect him, oppressed by the white people around him. He had so much anger as a young person, he called people white devils.

Now I’m going to use a framework described by Hegel of dialectic progression I learned about from [Claude](https://claude.ai/share/69541721-7c45-4f21-a5d4-24d3b4199c5b) and I think it helps structure this essay a bit.

Hegel’s dialectical progression operates through three moments: thesis → antithesis → synthesis, but it’s more dynamic than simple opposition-resolution.

The **thesis** presents an initial position or concept. But every thesis contains internal contradictions - it’s incomplete or one-sided, generating its own **antithesis** (opposite). The tension between these contradictions creates movement toward **synthesis** - not mere compromise, but a higher unity that preserves truth from both while transcending their limitations.

Malcolm X started with a thesis that white people were evil, but he had a turning point where his perspective changed. This was his antithesis period. He went to Africa for the Hajj and white people treated him as an equal instead of a second class citizen. He realized not all white people are evil. He felt united with people of every color through religion, and that violated his hateful thesis that white people were evil as the cause of his oppression.

Later in his life he talked more about universal human dignity and justice and respect, less centered around the dichotomy of race (black people good white people bad). He realized hate wasn’t the answer, that there were larger class dynamics at play, and that they could work together to overcome oppression. This was a larger synthesis, creating a new transcendent way of viewing the world that reconciles the thesis and the antithesis.

\[ As an aside, Martin Luther King was also super on this beat toward the end of his life too. He wrote criticisms of capitalism and wanted to move America toward a more socialist system. Not long after both these spiritual leaders made this philosophical pivot, they were assassinated. Theorize as you will. \]

Identity politics are a distraction from the real core conflict in our society today and that is the class struggle. There are haves and have nots, wealth is being concentrated for the haves. That is the source of oppression, not a group identified by race or gender or sexuality.

Here’s what I think a similar arc could look like for the white working class right now. I hope that in 50 years when people look back on what we did, this is what they say.

## **Thesis**

Upward mobility for white working class Americans has been on the decline, and they blame progressive politics and direct hate toward immigrants and queer people. This thesis is internally consistent, but we must remember that correlation does not mean causation. Society being more inclusive is not why jobs are going away.

## **Antithesis period**

We need to inject information that violates this thesis by bringing people together from different backgrounds. As the kind white Muslims inspired X to question his hatred of white people, white working class Americans must have human conversations with people who are different from them that they make assumptions about. Actual conversations between MAGA republicans and immigrants or trans people. I have learned so much in these conversations as someone who does not come from these communities. The only way we come together is by being humble and vulnerable, asking and answering questions from a place of curiosity and showing kindness. We need to disprove the original thesis.

## **Synthesis period**

Once this happens, white working class Americans will realize people coming from different identities are not the cause of their oppression, people coming from wealth are. The reason your job went away is because a corporation wanted to cut costs by deploying a machine to do your job. The reason you don’t have health insurance is because rich people don’t want their taxes to go up in support of nationalized free health care. None of this is because gay people are committing sin or illegal immigrants are taking over the country. It’s because power and capital are concentrated in the hands of a few and they are hoarding all the resources for themselves.

So Malcolm X was not a perfect man. To quote my favorite musical, Wicked, “the most celebrated are the rehabilitated”. X a complex figure in American history with lots of moral ambiguity in his story, but moral ambiguity is not inherently a bad thing. We are complex creatures in a changing society. We need to form new higher order transcendent moral systems. And the only way we do that is by having uncomfortable conversations and shedding old unhelpful narratives. It’s been done before, we can do it again.
