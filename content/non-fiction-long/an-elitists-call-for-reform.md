# An elitist's call for reform

## **tldr**

Wealth will be redistributed whether the elite want it to or not. It can either be forcefully redistributed or it can be peacefully granted. The longer billionaires hoard the wealth, the more painful and destructive the transfer will be.

## **Background on wealth stratification**

Wealth has become extremely stratified in America. 10% hold 67% of the wealth. The bottom 50% hold just 2%. America has not had this level of stratification since the 1920s, just before the Great Depression ([source](https://www.stlouisfed.org/community-development/publications/the-state-of-us-household-wealth)). This level of stratification is not a stable amount to have in our economy: it leads to too much social frustration.

Most Americans wants wealth to be redistributed, but the remaining few have all the power. They run the markets and the economy, control political offices. The majority class has been excluded from positions of power so they cannot effect the change they want. They are repeatedly misled by politicians and have not yet been able to form an effective platform, but both of Trump's elections show that the sentiment is there.

Trump supporters believe their quality of life will be improved by enacting tariffs and other protectionist policies to bring business back to they’re communities. That economic policy has been disproven, but the sentiment is not stupid. The lower class seeks to make real economic change, but they have been excluded from the economic system and do not know how.

## **Politics**

The issue goes deeper than politics: it’s about class. Trump has hijacked the Republican Party by tapping into this anger, with empty promises that he’ll help those struggling to make ends meet. The Democrats use identity politics to distract us from the true issue: that wealth has become too concentrated. That's why the DNC never enacts any meaningful change while they hold office and fail to win important elections: the campaigns they run are fundamentally lies designed to manipulate and control people.

Trump has identified and used this sentiment to his advantage. But this discontentment will only grow from the rising wealth stratification that will ensue from his presidency. There will come a time when no misleading politician can keep the revolution at bay.

## **Capitalism vs civilization paradoxes**

Class issues transcend politics because our democratic and capitalist system has an incentive misalignment. The rules of the market are inextricably linked with the behavior and governance of the people; the two reference each other too deeply and the system breaks down. We are running into logical paradoxes. Wealth will not be redistributed within the existing laws of our government and economic system.

We need to act against our monetary best interest and redistribute the wealth before the 90% lose faith and overthrow the system. Capitalism teaches us to follow our own self interest to accumulate as much wealth as possible. But we have taken this value too far to the extreme. **I am not going to condescend to say you should give to the poor out of the goodness of your heart: you must redistribute wealth for your own self interest.**

It goes against capitalist logic to give away wealth, but the market does not exist in a vacuum. It exists in a society of fundamentally irrational animals who are trying to survive. People are not a theoretical concept whose behavior we can abstract away endlessly.

Our species did not first evolve to have markets to improve quality of life. We developed civilizations and governments to prevent violence between humans so we could all stay alive. Having a stable civilization is the bedrock on which capitalism and markets are built.

## **Historical precedent**

Massive wealth disparities and redistribution has occurred before in our history. The New Deal after the Gilded Age was a moment of wealth transfer in our nation’s recent history. We needed to redistribute wealth to keep the general populous from rising up and overthrowing the system. These billionaires knew how and where to deploy capital to bolster the lives of the lives of the lower and middle class, placating them to stave off revolution.

Alternatively, there have been moments in history when the elite did not relinquish their wealth and violent social revolution ensued. We saw this in the French Revolution and the Chinese Revolution. The wealthy got cocky and disconnected from the general population. The general population violently attacked, chopped off their heads and sent the wealth to reeducation camps.

## **Call to action**

Once you are convinced a change will be made, you realize it’s just a matter of when. Billionaires and those in power hold the fate of how graceful the transition will be. The elite can recognize the moment in history and relinquish some of their wealth. They needn’t hand over all, but enough to calm the revolutionary push. Quality of life for most Americans must improve.

If it doesn’t, the people will seek to overthrow the system. As soon as people's lives are better in revolution than in the existing system, they revolt. We are already seeing this with the January 6th coup, the George Floyd movement, and Luigi Mangione. Right now, these are 3 separate groups with often conflicting political agendas, but soon they will realize that they are all inciting violence for the same fundamental reason: a redistribution of wealth and power. Soon, the revolution will become too big to stop or ignore, disrupting our way of life.

It is not in our best interest for the political and economic system to crumble. It is not in the elites best interest, and right now it is not in the best interest for most of the middle class. But soon, if people continue to have a declining relative quality of life, If the rich get richer and the poor continue to stagnate, it will be in more people’s self interest to revolt against the government and incite violence.

## **Contextualizing**

No government system lasts forever; all systems fall. The mark of a strong civilization is how long it manages to keep the peace. The United States of America has managed to maintain a peaceful order for almost 300 years. We could devolve into violence in the name of preventing market distortion, or we could meet the moment and redistribute wealth. The only way to maintain our way of life is to uplift the lower classes and keep the peace.
