# A call for empathetic product engineers

There are two types of builders. People who build things to prove how smart they are, and people who build things because they want to solve problems. The best builders are driven by a need to fix things from a very young age. They take things apart just to put them back together. They feel for people dealing with problems and need to figure out the solution for them.

For too long, engineering has been gate kept by people who like to feel like the smartest person in the room. They use obscure jargon and don’t bother explaining their thinking. Software is a complex domain, but it’s understandable. Keeping people out is a disservice done to create scarcity and drive up demand for themselves.

There has never been an easier time to create software. The history of programming languages is a story of creating higher level abstractions to get machine language closer to human language. With the advent of AI software tools, this story just took another massive leap. Anyone with a Wifi connection and a couple bucks can go from idea to app in less than an hour.

While there is still important work to do ensuring that the software we ship is secure and scalable, the rest of us can spend more time finding and solving problems. AI tools free us of a lot of the tedium of software engineering so we can focus on the human aspect of building good products.

Every product on the market right now is a want or a need someone had that another person solved for them. Want to water a plot of land far from a river? Create irrigation. Looking to get to the other side of that river? Someone built a bridge. Want to buy a home but don’t have the capital on hand? Someone will loan it to you, and you can pay them back. It’s in the name — “goods and services”.

Every time we solve one problem, another crops up in its place; two steps forward one step back. But through this virtuous cycle, we have a truly prolific and diverse market of products to solve all the problems one might face. Want dinner delivered to your door? A vaccine for a new disease? To find love? There’s an app for that. While not every problem a human may face is a problem meant to be solved with technology, it’s truly impressive everything we have built together.

Right now, a lot of the frontier problems we still need to solve will be solved with technology. There is a reason [software is eating the world](https://a16z.com/why-software-is-eating-the-world/), it’s a fantastic tool to solve problems. This is why it’s such a sin that it has been gate kept; there are so many problems to solve we need all hands on deck.

So I guess what I’m trying to say is if I can do it, so can you. Don’t let poor communicators convince you that you can’t figure it out, complex problems just take longer to figure out but anyone can get there. As someone behind the gate, I can attest there’s nothing special in here you don’t have out there. So come on in.

What this field needs is more empathetic problem solvers, not the latest genius out of Stanford. Become a software engineer not because of the way people look at you when you tell them you study CS, or because that’s where the biggest salaries are (though I admit, those aren’t bad perks). Become a software engineer because you hate inefficiency and you want to solve the problems you can.

The industry has never been more accessible, and there has never been a time when we needed people driven by empathy more. There’s not one problem that will save us all; it takes many people many days of creating thoughtful products but bit by bit we live in a safer, more abundant world.
