# A call to build a new moral system

In “Forgetting Morality” I wrote about how we as a species had surpassed morality, we had other institutions, like the market, that allowed us to cooperate at scale. Two years and 100 days of a new Trump presidency later, I am not so sanguine that we can operate without a moral system. The fabric of society is crumbling as neighbors are pitted against each other for what they perceive as scarce resources, which the rich knowingly hoard. Our lack of spirituality and interconnectedness will leave our tenuous world order in taters.

Activists like Malcom X, Betty Friedman, and Harvey Milk spent the 60’s and 70’s dismantling the prevailing moral systems because they oppressed people of color, women, and queer people. They rightfully asserted who we were not as a community, and drove out toxic ideals. Conservatives look at this era with disdain because it disrupted the world order; liberals hail it as an important stage of progress. But no one told us what comes next.

I already wrote about the importance of a moral system in society. Consider it a preread. Now that we have established a moral system that is vital to the wellbeing of a society and that modern American society is lacking one, we can go about the important task of designing a new one.

Many may think this lack of moral system is a position of weakness, but I think our current lack of moral system is a position of strength. In software engineering, we have this concept called “tech debt” – bad code that was written in the past, when we had less information than we do now, but that we now must maintain to keep the system working. With no moral system to speak of, we have no tech debt; we are starting with a clean slate. Other societies, namely those in the East, like China, have established moral systems that have existed for thousands of years. Those moral systems are laden with dated, unproductive ideas (ie patriarchy) which served a different era. American’s can design a moral system for the modern age.

What do we need from this moral system? Social cohesion is certainly of high importance, but we can strive for more. The question is synonymous with who we want to be, what type of society we all want to live in.

I want to live in a society where everyone is cared for. Bryan Stevens, a civil rights lawyer known for his work defending people on death row, once said a society is defined not by how it treats its best, but how it treats its worst. As an expensively educated, high achieving student, this struck a chord.

America prides itself on its intellectualism and innovation. We are a strong nation because we have many smart people who live in very beautiful homes. I used to believe that was the defining American experience, but it is not. The defining American experience is a poor mentally ill person living on the streets or ending up incarcerated. This life experience is not inevitable, it is a collective decision to turn our backs on each other when things get hard. We will become a more moral society and a stronger nation when we no longer let each other suffer in poverty.

To achieve this, empathy must be central to the new moral system. A sense of interconnectedness, akin to what is meant when Christian’s say “all of God's creatures” must re-enter American thought. We owe each other something, all of our fates are intertwined. As Martin Luther King said,

> *“In a real sense all life is interrelated. All men are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be, and you can never be what you ought to be until I am what I ought to be… This is the interrelated structure of reality.”* – a letter from Birmingham jail.

Americans have strayed too far on the path of hedonistic individualism and are dissatisfied with the lonely, spiritually devoid life that leads to. The creed of self interests enriches the rich and leaves us, a fundamentally social animal, feeling isolated.

I don’t know the details of how our new moral system will work, but I know it must be rooted in the emotions of compassion, empathy, and interconnectedness. We will only be allowed into the future together, division will keep us all trapped in the past.
