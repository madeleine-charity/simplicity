# Let's take the ego out of entrepreneurship

The start up I work at was recently acquired by a leader in the space. It was a huge success and a life changing moment for everyone at the company. We did it as a team.

The company was able to succeed because it was composed of a group of high skill people who were able to work together. We have generational leaders in our founding team who enable all of us to do our best work and keep us all coordinated and organized.

When the CEO of the company that acquired us spoke about why he chose us, he called out our humility. We view our product not as something to conform to, but as something that makes other products better and lifts up the space. This is how we achieved market dominance— through humility.

For too long, we have let the egotists control innovation. We have let myths of lone geniuses who changed the world in just a thought dictate our histories of invention. But anyone who has actually built something that lasts knows good products are not built by a single person, they are built by teams.

“If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” All startups begin as a mad dash of a few people just trying to find their footing as fast as possible. It is important for startups to move fast in the early stages; iterate or die. But this loner stage cannot last for long if the company is going to succeed in the long run.

My dad loves to tell me to be skeptical of anyone who claims to have all the answers. The history of Silicon Valley is filled with narratives of great white men who stepped onto the scene and with a wave of their magic wand, changed the way we interact with technology forever. But it would be folly to believe that is the whole story.

All lasting products were built by teams, even if a large part of that team operated behind the scenes. Often, good builders don’t want to be thrust into the spotlight— it’s not the personality type. Think Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, there are public and private roles to play.

We have let the narrative of the lone genius allow egotists to take sole control of companies others have also worked hard to build. Think Mark Zuckerberg and the Winklevoss twins.

This narrative damages everyone involved, from the contributors who are boxed out of their earnings to the egotist who feels they must make great sacrifices to live up to their larger than life image. No one can do it alone, and believing that we can only leads to disappointment and resentment.

Being driven by ego is destructive; it hurts the soul and erodes what makes us human. Great products, first and foremost, are deeply empathetic. The first step to building a great product is finding product market fit, which is the VC jargon way to say finding what tools people need built. Too much focus on the self and the overgrowth of the ego make it harder to connect with others and deeply understand what they need built.

We can, however, do it together. People do their best work when they feel appreciated and seen. Imagine what we will accomplish when we stop worshiping founders and start enabling entire teams to succeed.

No one can do great things alone, that’s why we developed language and economies to be able to organize ourselves to work together. If it took a single person to build great products, there would be no venture capital because there would be no need to build teams.

Even if a single person has the ability to do the job of everyone else on the team, we are all fundamentally limited by time. We are not gods, the amount we can get done in a day is finite. We all need others to help expand and continue our work. Pretending that we can get everything done on our own just limits what we can accomplish together.

So my call to action is to not buy into the narrative. Don’t be fueled by ego, instead invest time, energy, and resources into building a team culture that enables and inspires everyone to do their best work.
