# How technology makes us better people

There’s a lot of anxiety going around right now over what we will all do if AI takes our jobs. I personally would love for AI to automate as much of my job so I can spend more time on other parts of my life that make me a better human.

Let’s back up first, and talk about why we all have jobs. The hard truth is we are animals trying to survive on a planet with limited resources. We need to produce to survive; without labor, there wouldn’t be enough {food, shelter, clothes} to go around. I love to critique capitalism as much as the next girl, but between capitalism and a world where billions starve, capitalism is definitely the lesser evil.

That being said, the history of technology is the history of being able to produce more outputs with fewer inputs. Aqueducts allowed us to farm where we couldn’t before, fertilizers made crop yields more abundant, and machines that harvest crops for us allow kids to get out of the fields and into classrooms. When technology frees us up from needing to work to produce, we can go make investments in the more human parts of life.

Let’s take manufacturing automation as an idealized example. When we first invented the assembly line, they took a lot of labor to run. Kids had to work in factories to keep them running to produce. This was obviously morally objectionable, but we needed the production to support a growing population. It was when we made innovations in manufacturing efficiency, meaning they required less labor, that we were able to take kids out of factories. Technology allows us to be a more moral society.

\[I left a lot out of that example, valiant activists protested to get kids out of factories and yes we need food but do we need to produce consumerist playthings? This is a separate conversation, and I like to keep these essays short.\]

Now’s the part where I harp on moral relativism, because there’s a lot of moral ambiguity in what I just said. Many people will disagree with this, but my take is that people are not either moral / immoral, we are all just in environments where resources are abundant / scarce.

Little Fires Everywhere

This is a hard pill for the elite among us to swallow. I also want to believe I do not lie, steal, cheat because I’m a morally superior being and not just because I’ve never been in a reality where resources were scarce. But if I’m honest I would probably act criminally if I had to to survive (queue Les Miserables). Everyone has to eat somehow, but only some of us are handed food.

Framed this way, the enemy is not irredeemable immoral people, but scarcity. If everyone lived in abundance, we would live in a more moral world. Now given that we live on a finite planet with finite resources, how do we create a society where resources are abundant? The options are either get rid of the surplus population, or create technology that allows us to do more with less. I choose option B.

So now we are back to AI. What automated manufacturing did for manual labor decades ago, AI will do for thinking jobs today. This is a really scary idea for a society that allocates scarce resources based on how productive individuals are, but what if resources weren’t scarce? What if losing your job didn’t feel like losing your means to survival, but meant you could spend more time with your loved ones?

This is a utopic view and it’s going to take more than technology to get us there. The government is going to have to step up in a big way and make sure a few people don’t hog all the new resources AI generates. But the dream of living in a post scarcity utopia feels closer than it ever has in human history. I think that’s something to be excited about.

The failure mode here is greed and over consumption. We can get to a place where everyone can have enough, but only if a few don’t splurge on unnecessary toys like super yachts and fancy sports cars. I personally believe no one really benefits from over consumption. There’s a growing body of research to support that things are just things and material don’t really make us happier long term (You are over spending because you lack values). What we all really want is a loving community, but some who lack a loving community will try to fill the hole with stuff and hog the resources. We will need to rehabilitate these people and beat out this moral corruption.

There’s a lot to get us there and we will hit many road bumps in the process, but we should all keep our eyes on the horizon. There’s a lot to be hopeful about.
