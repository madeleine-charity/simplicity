# The Future is Female

For the last millennia, humans have spent most of their time trying to survive violence and starvation. The advantage in these problems is to be big and strong, traits men have the biological advantage over. But human history has progressed such that the amount of us struggling to put food on the table or physically fighting each other has gone down. These are wonderful advancements due to innovation in technology and social organization. The skills that shine in our new world are no longer brute strength, but empathy and the ability to cooperate with others.

In the last few decades in the world's most developed economies, the sectors that have grown the most are service sectors. These are jobs where empathy is most important; caring for children, the elderly, and the sick. Jobs in sectors where physical strength (which have been predominantly male) are on the decline.

The jobs that men were good at are being automated. This benefits everyone – increased efficiency means more goods for everyone. Even the classic male role of warrior is on the decline, as most of us have been fortunate enough to live in an era of global peace for most of our lives. As the roles that men used to have the advantage over decline, men are now lacking purpose.

Trump rode this wave into office. He told men he would bring back their jobs in coal mines and factories, along with a bunch of other rhetoric catering to low male self esteem. Liberals were too busy celebrating the progress and attempting to keep us moving forward, that they forgot the people who were winning in the old world were left behind. Democrats told these laborers to reskill, but maybe it's time to accept that they can’t.

Women are better at empathy and prosocial behavior than men ([source](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1963313/#:~:text=Much%20research%20has%20shown%20that,for%20men%20or%20for%20women.)) and are thus better positioned to succeed in the new economy. We are predisposed to be better at service jobs that require caring for others and have the skills to work together on teams. The future is female because we have solved the problems men were good at solving; the problems of today require a more feminine skill set.

# We can’t go back

This progress is a good thing for everyone, not just for women. Violence and starvation are suffering, and this progress means less human suffering.

We cannot let insecure patriarchal rhetoric undermine and reverse this progress. We must continue to improve the human condition, even if the new world we create is not inherently patriarchal but matriarchal.

Trump seeks to return us to a patriarchal society not just by attacking birth control and spewing blatant misogyny, but by bringing male dominated jobs back to our economy. He has tariffed developing nations to bring manufacturing jobs back on shore. His style of leadership as the president of the US lowers the behavioral standard to one that men can meet. He normalizes a lack of empathy and megalomaniac behavior that we had evolved beyond.

We must treat this movement as the final hail mary of the patriarchal world. The patriarchy knows it is under attack, and seeks to bring us all down with it– we cannot let it. The social disorder we feel right now is the desperate attack of a dying animal, scrambling to find anyway to survive. We cannot let it be a fundamental reversal of all the progress we have made as a species.

# Designing around women

Now that we have decentered the patriarchy, we can redesign our society in a way that works for all of us. The most pressing issue to take on is declining birth rates. Educated working women are having kids later in life, or not at all. Since women are now welcome in the economy, we can financially provide for ourselves and no longer need to get married to get by. With the advent of birth control, we can control if and when we have kids.

In fact, without the financial necessity of marriage, women are going so far as to opt out of relationships with men all together in what is known as the [4B movement](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/09/us/4b-movement-trump-south-korea-wellness-cec/index.html). The prospect of working outside the home while also doing a larger share of domestic labor at home and bearing children has lost its appeal to young women. We would rather be financially independent and not have to rely on a man than tether ourselves to one in the name of economic stability. As marriage and kids become less attractive to large swaths of women, birth rates decline.

People assigned female at birth hold the power when it comes to bringing in the next generation, we must be catered to as such. Men can grind through their twenties and early thirties and decide to have kids later in life. We need to redesign the peak fertility years to encourage women to have kids. If we continue to view the 20s as the only time to establish yourself in your career, we will see women choose work over having kids over and over again, and birth rates will continue to fall.

# Closing

Change is scary. All periods of social change have been marked by discomfort and social disorder as some realize where we are going before others do. I am filled with hope that the society we are building will be better not just for women, but for everyone. We cannot act with vengeance against men who have kept women down
