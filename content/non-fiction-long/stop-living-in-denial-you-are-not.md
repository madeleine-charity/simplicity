# Stop living in denial: you are not in control

Free will has been disproven. We have spent millennia trying to prove it exists and still haven’t come up with anything. We can break down and study our bodies and behaviors at every level of abstraction. (Robert Sapolsky has influenced my thinking a lot here, check out his books and lectures.)

And yet despite all this evidence, we still want to believe we have free will and there is some small part of us that is in control. This is living in denial. We are all just energy flowing through a complex system. Things happen to us, whether we want them to or not. There are always bigger forces at play. We are all experiencing what life throws at us, no one is really at the wheel. It’s so painfully obvious, fighting it hurts but acceptance is easy. Give up the illusion of control.

Accepting I am not in control is how I have found peace. I think of that rhyme our parents would tell us as kids “you get what you get and you don’t get upset”. Stop whining about it and play the hand you are dealt.

The people who do not accept reality are the people that cause the most harm to others. It’s the megalomaniacs who spend all their energy trying to exert their will on the world who kill the most people. Think Genghis Khan, who killed tens of millions of people in his conquests for world domination. Today we see this behavior pattern in men like Donald Trump and Elon Musk. It’s ego sickness.

Once you accept none of us are in control, you open yourself up to radical empathy. We are all on the same ride, we are all experiencing the same Life. No one really has more control than anyone else, we are all just playing out parts of a larger deterministic machine. We are so much more similar than we are different.
