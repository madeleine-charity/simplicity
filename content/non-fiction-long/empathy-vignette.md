# Empathy vignette

It was a rainy Sunday morning. She woke up to the tap tap tap of raindrops hitting the window outside the apartment, then the press of a car horn. Late morning, then. She opened her eyes to see the fruit market across the street set up and the sidewalk full of people. She’d learn to tell time by the movements of strangers outside her window.

The apartment was cold but the bed was warm. She rolled over, curling into his heat, but he stayed perfectly still. He didn’t pull her in, or push her away. He’d been despondent since they had heard of his father’s death. Since then, she had been left with the disconcerting realization that they were not in control. And he hadn’t said anything.

Slowly, a chasm was opening up between them. When she asked, he didn’t answer. He looked at everything with an indifference in his eyes, like he was looking past the object of his focus. But she didn’t think he was looking at anything at all.

At least he still seemed to see her, but it was in a distant sort of way. Like he was standing on the banks of a river, and she was an odd piece of debris floating past. A large tree that had fallen in a storm. She tried to swim upstream to reach him but she couldn't, he kept getting smaller and smaller and he stayed perfectly still.

“Share it with me” she said, unable to accept the growing distance between them. He softly nodded against her head. She rolled up on top of him, laying her knees on either side of his hips. She leaned forward to press her forehead into his and wrapped her fingers around the base of his neck to pull his thick brown hair, bracing.

She took a deep breath and in flowed despair. Her body almost sagged into him at the weight of it. Every cell in her body seemed to leaden, her stomach hollowed out. She forced her body to stay upright.

Next came fear, and she would have balled her fists if her fingers weren’t so heavy. Her heart began to race at the speed of the raindrops pitter patter against the window and her body started to heat up. She felt like she had been dropped out of the sky into a new world, and didn’t know if she was safe or not. Or even how to find out.

Finally came guilt. The unshakable sense she could have prevented it all, that she had missed something. Nausea roiled in her stomach and a rock settled in the back of her throat. That surprised her, he had done nothing wrong.

They stayed like that for a few more moments. Breathing, feeling. Someone’s tears wet the pillow case below them. Until they had had enough and she slowly lowered herself down back on the bed. He pressed his head into hers and threw his arm around her, pulling her closer.
