# Why we need morals

There is no moral objectivity: no divine creature decides what is right or wrong. But that doesn’t mean morals have no value to us as a species.

Morals are an important social organization tool. They are a tool to control people which can be wielded for better or worse. They encourage the behavior we want from our fellow humans.

We are faced with many decisions over the course of our lives. These decisions are often when our personal wants and needs are at odds with the wants and needs of others. Should I move back home to take care of a sick parent? Should I raise my own salary, at the expense of those who work with me? There is no objectively right answer to any of these questions, arguments can be made for both courses of action. When we are driven by a sense to “do the right thing”, Morals nudge us toward certain behavior over others. These behaviors lead us toward pro social behavior, benefiting a larger society over our own needs.

Society has changed a lot in the last 100 years. New technologies have changed our way of life. Our society is no longer organized in the ways of the past. With fewer Americans identifying as religious, we have shed ancient moral systems like Christianity.

This change has often been for the better; societies of the past had enslavement and the oppression of women. People were punished for love on the basis of their gender. I believe it is positive progress that we have shed the moral systems that supported these societies. Women do not feel like they must stop working once they become a mother. Gay people do not believe their love is a sin. We have rightfully dismantled these organizing systems.

But we have yet to build a new moral system in its place. The values in our society are incredibly, and often paralyzingly, pluralistic. We lack a collective consciousness around what is right and wrong. This has led to much social turmoil in recent elections and a general distrust of each other. Our social cohesion is crumbling.

Our strength as a species is our ability to work together in groups. Together, we can build stronger civilizations with economies and specialization. We can provide enough resources for everyone’s survival, and then some. This social organization is possible by the moral systems we have devised to control larger populations.

Consider the 6th of the 10 commandments: you shall not murder. Simple enough now, but there was a time where people feared for their lives around their fellow man. We are all better off in a society where no one kills each other, but this is a collective action problem. Violence begets violence. We needed to progress past common violence to work together and build large scale civilizations. We invented morals to root out these unwanted behaviors, in a way no single person could do.

We must come together and construct a new, progressive moral system for modern society. Morals are not a thing of the past designed to oppress the masses, they are an important social organization tool that can bring us together in important, productive ways. While many of us may no longer take moral objectivity seriously anymore, we must recognize the important function morals play in the success of our species. We are all better off in a more moral, cohesive society.
