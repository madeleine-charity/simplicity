# How to live the Good Life

I’ve been writing a lot about empathy and being egoless, but how do we actually do that? Below is a non exhaustive list, but a start.

1. **Love everyone** – Love yourself, love your family, love strangers. Always love deeply and wholeheartedly, when you feel it lean into it. When you need to make a decision, choose the course that feels most deeply rooted in love.

2. **Forgive** – “Everybody makes mistakes” - Hannah Montana. Don’t expect others (or yourself) to be perfect. When people make mistakes, acknowledge and forgive them. Learn and grow from it together, instead of dwelling on the damage that was caused.

3. **Be curious and ask questions** — People are different, we come from different backgrounds and have different life experiences. We won’t all know about everyone else's culture and perspective — that’s ok. Seek to understand others. Don’t shy away when someone is talking about an experience that is different from yours, view it as an opportunity to learn more about the human experience.

4. **Give the benefit of the doubt** — No one is out to get you. Always assume others are coming from a place of curiosity instead of viewing ignorance as an attack. Don’t get defensive and shut them out, bring people in. It’s better to have given the benefit of the doubt and have gotten hurt, than to have shut out someone who was genuinely curious and empathetic.

5. **Put others' needs before your own** — This is an “eat your veggies” principle. We all know we should do it, but it can be hard in the moment. I always try to at least do the things that make others' lives better more than they make mine worse. The economist in me thinks this is creating value, life is not a zero sum game and we can make Life (not just for any one of us, but the broader experience of human life) better.

6. **Look for connections** — Everyone is living the same life. The world is rich with different cultures, but at our core we are all the same. Look for similarities where others may only see differences. You might be surprised at how interconnected we all are.

7. **Growth mindset** — To be human is to be fallible. You will never be perfect, so stop pretending you are. Learn from mistakes and strive to be better but know you will never be perfect. Practice humility and remember there is always room to grow.

These ideas are not new, and all of them have been said before. I used AI to help find the information to root this in existing spiritual systems. Side note, I’ve been thinking of using AI as a way to query human knowledge. This is flawed as it is mostly trained on the western canon, but a cool way to use a new tool.

> Prompt: *For each point I have laid out, link it to a major concept in one of the world’s major religions.*

**1\. Love everyone — Agape (Christianity)** - This unconditional, self-sacrificing love that Jesus taught as the greatest commandment: “Love your neighbor as yourself.” It’s love that seeks the good of others regardless of personal benefit or whether it’s reciprocated.

**2\. Forgive — Teshuvah (Judaism)** - The concept of repentance and return, which emphasizes that forgiveness creates opportunities for healing and growth rather than punishment. It’s about restoring relationships and moving forward together.

**3\. Be curious and ask questions — Jihad al-Nafs (Islam)** - The “greater jihad” or inner struggle to overcome ignorance and grow in understanding. This includes the Islamic emphasis on seeking knowledge and understanding others as a form of worship and self-improvement.

**4\. Give the benefit of the doubt — Ahimsa (Hinduism/Buddhism)** - Non-violence in thought, word, and deed. This includes not harboring hostile assumptions about others’ intentions and approaching interactions with compassion rather than suspicion.

**5\. Put others’ needs before your own — Seva (Sikhism)** - Selfless service to others, especially those in need. It’s considered one of the highest forms of spiritual practice and a way to dissolve ego while serving the divine in others.

**6\. Look for connections — Ubuntu (African Traditional Religion) -** “I am because we are.” This philosophy recognizes that our humanity is interconnected and that we can only truly be human in relationship with others.

**7\. Growth mindset — Kaizen (Zen Buddhism)** - The practice of continuous improvement and accepting imperfection as part of the human journey. It emphasizes progress over perfection and embracing mistakes as learning opportunities.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
