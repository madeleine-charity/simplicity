# An argument for expansiveness

As a mixed race person, I’ve grappled a lot with the “what are you” question. We all want people to fit in a clean box– black or white, boy or girl. There’s a quote from the movie about Barack Obama, “Barry” where he’s complaining to a friend about being the only black person in the class. The friend goes "But you're half white too; you can fit in anywhere" and Barry replies "I don't fit in anywhere".

This used to really resonate with me– there wasn’t one place where I neatly fit in. But as I’ve gotten older, I have grown to appreciate the importance of expansiveness. Being able to fit in multiple situations is an incredible skill in the modern global world. Membership in one group does not preclude membership in any other groups. I was the social chair of my sorority and now I am a software engineer at a deeply technical start up– the two are not mutually exclusive.

People who are only one thing are boring, we should all strive to have as many diverse life experiences as we can. Each one teaches us something new about the human condition and gives us the ability to relate to a broader set of people. The same way trying lots of different foods makes you a better cook, having lots of different experiences can help make you a better person.

## **Romantic relationships**

One of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of my life so far has been my relationship with my boyfriend. We started dating when we were in high school, about 8 years ago. Most romantic relationships that start at that age fail because it's a tumultuous stage of life where our personalities change. I think the reason our relationship has been able to succeed is because we give each other room to grow and define ourselves expansively. We were never just one thing to each other, so we could each pick up and drop identities without it shaking the foundation of our relationship.

Whether or not the falling marriage rate is a good or bad sign is another post. But I think we can partly accredit the decline in long term relationships to close mindedness and an unwillingness to try new things. Because of my heterosexual relationship, I have watched movies and read books in genres I had never looked twice at before. While I was not initially interested in the media, I have grown to appreciate it and the experiences that inspired it. It has broadened my view of the world, and even my own personal identity.

## **Conclusion**

So give up on trying to fit into one neatly stereotyped identity, that sort of pseudo order is intellectually lazy. Seek out as many diverse experiences as you can. Travel is the commonly recommended way to do this, but there are plenty of ways to explore different cultures on a budget. Read books that weren’t written for you, read articles you think you will disagree with. Let curiosity drive you to be as expansive a person as you can be.
