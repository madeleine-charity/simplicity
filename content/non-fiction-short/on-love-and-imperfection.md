# On love and imperfection

When did relationships become about finding the perfect person? Checklists and snap judgements. 'too short' 'not cute' at first turns into 'he just gave me the ick' after a minor mistake, like a mistimed burp or poor choice of words.

Love is not a performance, its understanding who a person truly is. It is in the moments when a person is most imperfect when they are most primed for love. Our flaws make us who we are, they differentiate us. To see someone's flaws and imperfections is to know that person, to smile in the face of these imperfections is to love them.
