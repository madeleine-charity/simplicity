# The fire in the desert

In a vast desert that never ended, there was a small fire. And around this fire, two people sat.

One wanted to leave the fire, to figure out how to escape the desert. He worried that something might come out of the darkness surrounding them, he felt they weren't safe and had to get out.

The other warned him to stay. She asked what if the desert goes on forever? What if we spend our whole lives wandering around? We have this fire to tend; if it goes out we will have nothing. We cannot leave, we are the people sitting by the fire.
